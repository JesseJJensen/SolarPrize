# American-Made Solar Prize Software Track Submission For Ready
## Response to Question 1:
OEO seeks to address the affordable housing crisis as well as implement use of solar technologies utilizing allocated funds. The National Low Income Housing Coalition examines the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) yearly to identify the availability of rental homes to those earning 30% of the area median income or “living below the poverty line” - whichever is greater - referred to as “extremely low incomes”.  In 2020, the NLIHC found that 25% (10.9 million) of renter households are living with “extremely low incomes.” Furthermore, 71% of those 10.9 million renter households are housing-cost burdened - spending more than half of their incomes on rents and utilities (National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2020, P.1-2). We believe if renters are unable to meet their basic need of housing, there is minimal/no incentive to seek out alternative energy sources. If there are no incentives for the investor to implement alternative energy sources - they are not going to do so.

OEO believes if the affordability of housing is solved through use of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and provides an avenue for allocating funds to cover the capital costs of solar technologies - the barriers to affordable housing and sustainable, renewable energies can be solved. Blockchain and DAO technologies are new, and by establishing a new, affordable, sustainable mechanism for addressing these issues now - we are setting the minimum standard while leading the way for future developers, investors, etc. to join in and continue to improve upon the system. Blockchain is the next step for real estate technological advancements and OEO is ready to act. 

“Absent public subsidy, the private market is unable to produce new rental housing affordable to these households, because the rents that the lowest-income households can afford to pay typically do not cover the development costs and operating expenses of new housing” (National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2020, P. 15). Additionally, a private investor or developer is not going to install solar technologies, which increases his initial costs while decreasing his net operating income.  The advantage to using a DAO, is there is no “need” for profits. By continuing to invest in “itself” - all funds are allocated to basic expenses, renter-subsidies, and use of renewable energy sources. 

OEO believes we have first movers advantage in this space. Our closest competitors would be those utilizing tokenization of Real Estate that could potentially pivot into our model. Currently, tokenized real estate is targeted toward investors (“accredited investors”) whereas we are utilizing tokenized real estate to target, (and empower), renters themselves. 

## Response to Question 2:
 OEO’s solution to the affordable housing crisis and implementation of use of solar technologies utilizing allocated funds is giving assets (i.e. housing) the ability to own themselves with governance by the people (i.e. renters) who use the assets with an established fund for solar initiatives. This is possible through tokenized real estate. OEO’s software is smart contracts that are stored on the Ethereum blockchain that together create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. In this solution the property will “own” itself through use of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and in exchange for rent payments, will distribute Governance Tokens to the renters which will provide them with the ability to vote on maintenance/management functions of the property. Instead of an investor or a property manager dictating changes and requirements to the property, the governance token holders will make those decisions together.

Smart Contract can be thought of as a tiny computer program stored inside of a blockchain, that completes an action when predetermined conditions are met; these programs are immutable and distributed; and developed using Solidity computer language. The Ethereum Blockchain is “community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency, ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications” (Ethereum.org). A Decentralized Autonomous Organization is the most complex form of a smart contract, where the bylaws of the decentralized organization are embedded into code; as opposed to a traditional top-down organization where a CEO is in control, a DAO is a bottom-up, self-enforcing entity where token holders validate decisions that enact the functions programmed into the smart contracts. OEO’s software will use ERC 20 Standard tokens; one representing property ownership (fixed amount) and one representing governance (infinite amount). ERC-20 tokens are fungible, or mutually interchangeable with unique identification numbers. Property ownership tokens will remain with the financier and then transfer to the property DAO. Governance tokens will be distributed to renters with each rent payment made providing them with the “right” to govern. 

1.) OEO will establish OEO LLC, as a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company; this allows for the creation of unlimited segregations of membership interests, assets, and operations into a SERIES.

2.) Each Series of the Series LLC will be treated as a separate entity and will own properties independently of each other. 

3.) Each Series of the Series LLC will have a fixed amount of ERC-20 Tokens (i.e. property ownership).

4.) Property Ownership ERC-20 Tokens will be transferred to the Decentralization Autonomous Organization (Property DAO).

5.) Renters will pay rents to the Property DAO

6.) Property DAO will mint and distribute 1 Governance Token for each USD of rent received to the renter. 

7.) Property DAO will make all required expense payments (i.e. Mortgage, Taxes, Insurances, and Solar Conversion Fund)

8.) Governance Token Holders will use the platform to create proposals and vote on how to budget and allocate additional funds (i.e. Property Management, Property Maintenance, etc.). 

9.) The Property DAO will execute approved proposals made by Governance Token Holders.

10.) The Property DAO will disperse remaining funds (i.e. “profits”) back to Residents at the property who maintain Governance Tokens, thereby subsidizing rents.  
	
The current standard is an investor-owned property where decisions are governed by that investor(s) to achieve an annual return rate of between 8-12%.  In OEO’s solution of a DAO-owned asset, the 8-12% is allocated to subsidize rents or fund governance proposals - thus creating affordable housing and providing renters with more input in their living arrangements. The OEO Platform will charge the following fees: 10% property acquisition fee (including for initial purchase, establishment of LLC, creation and assignment of tokens, hiring of initial property management, and establishing a maintenance fund); 2% total rents received; and 3% if a property is sold (i.e. leaves the platform). The OEO Platform’s fees and incentives for renters easily creates a sustainable business model. Once the mortgage is paid off, instead of a typical investor re-financing and continuing to charge fair-market rent or higher - OEO’s properties will have profits translating into significant subsidies for renters (i.e. lower rents). This is believed to be a sustainable model as once renters are met with the benefit of low-rent, others will want to participate in this model to achieve the same low-rents. 
OEO’s minimum viable product will include developing a user interface platform (a traditional website with functionality), using open source software that will allow us to develop ERC-20 Tokens, and proof of concept smart contract that allows us to show the exchange of tokens.  A critical failure would include not having the ability to create tokens; which would disrupt the assignment of property ownership and governance equity. 
A version of OEO’s software does not currently exist. The implementation of smart contracts on the blockchain and development of ERC-20 Tokens to provide fractionalized ownership does currently exist; and is being used by companies like RealT, Liberty Real Estate Fund, and others to provide fractionalized ownership to investors (who in turn are entitled to portions of the profits). See figure “Real Estate Tokenization.” While these companies appear to be operating in the same function OEO is, we plan on allocating profits to our governance token holders. See figure “OEO.” 
OEO will expand solar access to underserved populations by focusing on acquiring properties with renters who are housing-cost burdened. This model will provide significant control and benefit to those who obtain governance tokens. Renters traditionally have minimal-to-no say in changes to properties, rents, utilities, amenities, etc. Under OEO Property DAO, renters will be empowered to participate in decision making. Additionally, under OEO Property DAO, renters will be provided access to solar technologies through predetermined allocated funds.
