# American-Made Solar Prize Software Track Submission For Ready
## Response to Question 1:
OEO seeks to address the affordable housing crisis as well as implement use of solar technologies utilizing allocated funds. The National Low Income Housing Coalition examines the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) yearly to identify the availability of rental homes to those earning 30% of the area median income or “living below the poverty line” - whichever is greater - referred to as “extremely low incomes”.  In 2020, the NLIHC found that 25% (10.9 million) of renter households are living with “extremely low incomes.” Furthermore, 71% of those 10.9Response to Question 1:

The National Low Income Housing Coalition examines the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) yearly to identify the availability of rental homes to those earning 30% of the area median income or “living below the poverty line” - whichever is greater - referred to as “extremely low incomes”.  In 2020, the NLIHC found that 25% (10.9 million) of renter households are living with “extremely low incomes.” Furthermore, 71% of those 10.9 million renter households are housing-cost burdened - spending more than half of their incomes on rents and utilities (National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2020, P.1-2). We believe if renters are unable to meet their basic need of housing, there is minimal/no incentive to seek out alternative energy sources. If there are no incentives for the investor to implement alternative energy sources - they are not going to do so. 
OEO believes if the affordability of housing is solved through use of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and provides an avenue for allocating funds to cover the capital costs of solar technologies - the barriers to affordable housing and sustainable, renewable energies can be solved. Blockchain and DAO technologies are new, and by establishing a new, affordable, sustainable mechanism for addressing these issues now - we are setting the minimum standard while leading the way for future developers, investors, etc. to join in and continue to improve upon the system. Blockchain is the next step for real estate technological advancements and OEO is ready to act. 
“Absent public subsidy, the private market is unable to produce new rental housing affordable to these households, because the rents that the lowest-income households can afford to pay typically do not cover the development costs and operating expenses of new housing” (National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2020, P. 15). Additionally, a private investor or developer is not going to install solar technologies, which increases his initial costs while decreasing his net operating income.  The advantage to using a DAO, is there is no “need” for profits. By continuing to invest in “itself” - all funds are allocated to basic expenses, renter-subsidies, and use of renewable energy sources. 
OEO believes we have first movers advantage in this space. Our closest competitors would be those utilizing tokenization of Real Estate that could potentially pivot into our model. Currently, tokenized real estate is targeted toward investors (“accredited investors”) whereas we are utilizing tokenized real estate to target, (and empower), renters themselves.
